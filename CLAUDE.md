> ## ⚠️ This is Daybreak — a fork of Sunrise. Read this first.
>
> This repository is **Daybreak**, an AI-application framework built **on** the
> Sunrise platform (`human-centric-engineering/sunrise`), forked at Sunrise
> **v0.4.1**. You are **building on Sunrise, not developing Sunrise itself.**
>
> Everything below this banner is **Sunrise's own platform documentation**. Its
> guidance about how the codebase works still applies — but the _maintainer_
> workflows in it are **Sunrise's, not yours**: cutting Sunrise releases,
> "CHANGELOG follows the public surface", the public-surface `/pre-pr` checks,
> and `VERSIONING.md` all describe how the _platform_ is maintained upstream. In
> Daybreak you consume the platform; you don't version or release it.
>
> ### The golden rule: extend through the seams; don't edit platform-owned files.
>
> Every Sunrise-owned file you edit becomes a merge conflict the next time you
> pull a Sunrise release. Prefer adding new files and using the designed seams.
> Full playbook: [`CUSTOMIZATION.md`](./CUSTOMIZATION.md) (§0 app/platform model,
> §9 upstream sync) and [`.context/framework/README.md`](./.context/framework/README.md)
> (the three-tier model + ownership table).
>
> **Building or picking up a framework feature?** Start with
> [`.context/framework/planning/building-a-feature.md`](./.context/framework/planning/building-a-feature.md)
> — the operational flow (plan-first → per-task gate loop → close-out) — and the
> [board in `plan.md`](./.context/framework/planning/plan.md) for what's claimable. This saves
> you the learning curve the first features went through.
>
> **Three tiers: Sunrise → Daybreak → app.** Apps are built by forking **Daybreak**,
> not Sunrise. So Daybreak applies Sunrise's fork discipline _one level up_: it owns the
> framework layer and **reserves the leaf-app surface empty** for its own forks. Working in
> **this** repo you are building **Daybreak** — edit the framework layer, never the reserved
> leaf surface.
>
> **Daybreak-owned (the framework — edit these):**
>
> - `lib/framework/` — the framework code and its registration seams
>   (`registerModule()`, the map, slots, guidance, …); register into Sunrise's seams
>   **from here**, driven by `initFramework()`
> - `prisma/schema/framework-*.prisma` (your models) + `framework_…` migrations touching
>   only `framework_*` tables (the boundary CI keys on this prefix)
> - **`.context/framework/`** — Daybreak's own documentation tree
> - Daybreak identity: `package.json`, `README.md`, `CUSTOMIZATION.md`, `.env*`, and brand
>   values in `lib/app/brand.ts` — not by editing `lib/brand.ts`. (The old
>   `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_NAME` env vars were removed in Sunrise 0.11.0;
>   they are inlined at build time and never reached a container build.)
> - New framework files anywhere (admin pages/routes under a `framework` segment, `components/`)
>
> **Reserved for leaf apps (Daybreak keeps these EMPTY — do NOT fill):**
>
> - The `lib/app/*` **leaf** scaffolds (`env.ts`, `capabilities.ts`, `context-contributors.ts`,
>   `leaf-bootstrap.ts`, `leaf-admin-nav.ts`, …) — Sunrise ships them empty; Daybreak keeps them
>   empty for the app. Filling one collides with a leaf's registrations on a Daybreak upgrade.
>   **Exception — the six `lib/app/*` _bridges_ Daybreak DOES fill. This list is the
>   roster; count bridges here, not from an ordinal in a docblock:** `bootstrap.ts` (server boot →
>   `initFramework()`), `admin-nav.ts` (client sidebar → the framework nav section),
>   `data-export.ts` (GDPR Art. 15 subject access → the framework's own manifest at
>   `lib/framework/privacy/export-sources.ts`, declared through core's
>   `registerAppSubjectSources({ tier: 'framework' })`), `brand.ts` (product name + legal
>   entity → `lib/brand.ts`), `db-drift.ts` (Prisma-unmodelled DB objects → the framework's
>   drift probes), and `ci.ts` (coverage exclusions + always-run tests → `vitest.config.ts`
>   and `ALWAYS_RUN_TESTS`; Sunrise #759/#762). A framework registration that must run in a realm
>   `initFramework()` can't reach — server-boot, the client sidebar, a lazy seam core owns the
>   init of, or a static function core imports directly — has nowhere else to go; each bridge
>   delegates to a reserved leaf hook (`leaf-bootstrap.ts` / `leaf-admin-nav.ts` /
>   `leaf-data-export.ts` / `leaf-brand.ts`) so the leaf's own registrations never collide.
>   `brand.ts` is the one bridge where the leaf hook **overrides** rather than appends — brand
>   identity is single-valued, so a leaf replaces Daybreak's name, it does not compose with it.
> - `prisma/schema/app.prisma` + `app_…` migrations, `app/brand-theme.css`, and **`.context/app/`**
>
> **Sunrise-owned (do NOT edit; extend through a seam instead):**
>
> - Core `lib/` utilities, core `app/api/v1` routes, core `components/`, the
>   security / rate-limit middleware (`proxy.ts`, `lib/security/**`)
> - `lib/sunrise-version.ts`, `VERSIONING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `.context/**`
>   **except `.context/framework/` and `.context/app/`**, plus the SQL of any **Sunrise** migration
> - This `CLAUDE.md` **below the banner** — keep Daybreak-specific instructions
>   in this banner or in [`.context/framework/README.md`](./.context/framework/README.md), so
>   upstream `CLAUDE.md` edits merge cleanly
> - If you genuinely must change platform behaviour and no seam exists, keep the
>   edit minimal and add a follow-up rather than rewriting Sunrise's file — a
>   one-line "keep mine" is a cheap merge; a rewritten platform file is not
>
> ### Version model
>
> `package.json.version` is **Daybreak's** app version (surfaced via
> `lib/app-version.ts` → `/api/health` `version`). `lib/sunrise-version.ts` is
> the **Sunrise platform** version you forked from — you merge it through on
> upstream syncs; never edit it directly.
>
> ### Pulling upstream Sunrise
>
> Sunrise is the `upstream` remote. To adopt a release:
> `git fetch upstream --tags && git merge vX.Y.Z`. Resolve conflicts by keeping
> your version and adding follow-ups; then run `npm run db:migrate:status` →
> `db:migrate:dev` to apply newly-merged Sunrise migrations. See
> [`CUSTOMIZATION.md` §9](./CUSTOMIZATION.md).

Instructions for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Sunrise** is a production-ready Next.js 16 starter template with App Router, PostgreSQL/Prisma, better-auth, and Docker deployment. Optimized for AI-assisted development.

**Stack versions (breaking changes from prior versions — use MCP/Context7 for current docs):**

- **Next.js 16** — not 14/15 (new APIs, Cache Components)
- **React 19** — not 18 (new hooks, Server Components patterns)
- **Prisma 7** — not 5/6 (new client API)
- **Tailwind 4** — not 3 (completely different config, new syntax)

## Critical Rules

**These override defaults. Follow exactly.**

### Type Safety

- **Never use `as` on external data** (API responses, user input, env vars) — validate with Zod first
- **No `any` types** — use proper typing or `unknown` with type guards
- **Validate at boundaries** — all user input through Zod schemas

### Code Quality

- **Use `logger` not `console`** — structured logging from `@/lib/logging` for all production code
- **Search before creating** — check `lib/` for existing utilities before writing new ones
- **Keep it simple** — no features, refactoring, or "improvements" beyond what's requested

### Security

- **Rate limiting is automatic** — section caps are enforced by `proxy.ts` via the policy table at `lib/security/rate-limit-policy.ts`. New `/api/v1/**` routes inherit 100/min keyed on session-user with no handler work. Add per-flow sub-caps inside handlers only for expensive sub-flows (chat-stream, audio, image, upload, contact, etc.). Do not call section limiters (`adminLimiter`, `apiLimiter`, `authLimiter`) directly from route handlers — the middleware already did. See [`.context/security/rate-limiting.md`](./.context/security/rate-limiting.md).
- **Use auth guards** — `withAuth()`, `withAdminAuth()` from `lib/auth/guards.ts`
- **Run `/security-review`** before merging feature branches

### Architecture

- **API-first** — implement API endpoints before UI; every capability must be API-accessible
- **Server components by default** — add `'use client'` only when needed
- **No N+1 client-side fetches** — list/table pages get all data from a single enriched list endpoint; never fire per-row API calls in `useEffect`
- **Contextual help on form fields** — every non-trivial form field gets a `<FieldHelp>` ⓘ popover; see `.context/ui/contextual-help.md`
- **New `User` relations need an `onDelete` policy _and_ an export disposition** — any new model with a `userId`/`createdBy` FK must (1) declare `onDelete: Cascade` (personal data) or `onDelete: SetNull` (retained config/audit, FK nullable) — omitting it defaults to `Restrict` and silently breaks GDPR erasure; and (2) be added to `SUBJECT_DATA_SOURCES` in `lib/privacy/export-sources.ts`, which decides what a data subject receives from it. The second is enforced — `tests/unit/lib/privacy/export-sources.test.ts` parses the schema and fails until the model is listed. **Never delete a row from that manifest to make the test pass**; that ships a silently short answer to a data subject. Never call `prisma.user.delete()` directly — route account deletion through `eraseUser()`, and subject access through `exportUserData()`. See `.context/privacy/data-erasure.md` and `.context/privacy/data-export.md`.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` follows the public surface** — when a PR adds, removes, or changes a named seam, a documented public API, or a published Prisma model interface (see [`VERSIONING.md`](./VERSIONING.md#public-surface-contract-tight-definition)), append a bullet to `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## [Unreleased]` section as part of the same PR using [Keep-a-Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) categories (Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security). PRs that don't touch the public surface (internal refactors, tests, docs, chores) deliberately do **not** belong in the CHANGELOG — adding noise dilutes the signal forks rely on. `/pre-pr` step 5d flags public-surface diffs that omit a CHANGELOG entry.

## MCP Integration

### Next.js DevTools (Required)

**Always call `mcp__next-devtools__init` first** — do this without asking when starting work.

Use for: diagnostics, route inspection, runtime errors, browser automation, Next.js docs.

### Context7 (Library Docs)

Use for external library docs: `resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`. Essential for current Next.js/Prisma/Tailwind patterns.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev                    # Start dev server
npm run validate               # CHANGELOG + Node version + type-check + lint + format (Prettier + Prisma)

# Database
npm run db:migrate:dev         # Create and apply migration (dev only)
npm run db:migrate:deploy      # Apply pending migrations (prod / CI)
npm run db:migrate:status      # Show migration status
npm run db:seed                # Apply new/changed seed units
npm run db:reset               # Drop, re-migrate, re-seed from scratch
npm run db:studio              # Open Prisma Studio

# Testing
npm run test:changed           # Tests this branch affects + whole-tree guards (fast; what /pre-pr runs)
npm run test:changed:coverage  # ...and gate coverage per changed file (≥80% each)
npm run test                   # Full suite — for a merge from main, a release cut, or the whole picture
npm run test:watch             # Watch mode
npm run smoke:chat             # Smoke: streaming chat handler vs real dev DB

# Docker
docker-compose up              # Start dev environment
docker-compose down            # Stop services
```

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Route Groups

```
app/
├── (auth)/        # Auth pages (login, signup) — minimal layout
├── (protected)/   # Authenticated routes — requires session
├── (public)/      # Public routes — marketing, landing
├── admin/         # Admin dashboard — creates /admin/* URLs (not a route group)
└── api/v1/        # Versioned API endpoints
```

**Route groups** `(name)` organize code without affecting URLs. **Regular folders** like `admin/` create URL segments.

**Adding pages:** Same layout → add to existing group. Different layout → create new group or folder.

### Imports

Always use the `@/` path alias — never relative paths. Enforced by ESLint (`no-restricted-imports`).

```typescript
import { logger } from '@/lib/logging'; // ✅
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { FormError } from '@/components/forms/form-error'; // ✅ even for sibling files
import { logger } from '../../lib/logging'; // ❌
import { FormError } from './form-error'; // ❌ no exception for siblings
```

**Why no sibling-import exception:** Sunrise is a starter template. Downstream forks copy folders, rename modules, and split capsules — `@/` survives those moves; `./` breaks silently. A single mechanical rule is also grep-checkable by `/pre-pr` and `/code-review`, removes "is this local or cross-module?" judgment, and avoids the slow drift toward inconsistency that exception-laden rules invite. We accept the cost: cohesive capsules (`components/forms/`, `components/admin/orchestration/workflow-builder/`) read slightly more verbosely than they would with `./` siblings. That trade is intentional, not an oversight.

### API Response Format

```typescript
// Success
{ success: true, data: { ... }, meta?: { ... } }

// Error
{ success: false, error: { code: "ERROR_CODE", message: "...", details?: { ... } } }
```

## Test Engineering

Testing has a dedicated command workflow. The commands break down into three jobs — pick the one that matches the situation, don't loop them together reflexively.

### Three Jobs

| Job         | When                                         | Commands                                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Floor**   | Ongoing — raise quality on legacy test files | `/test-triage scan` → `worklist` → `rescan` · optionally `/test-fix from-rescan`             |
| **Ceiling** | One-shot — build out a critical module       | `/test-coverage` → `/test-plan coverage` → `/test-write plan` → `/test-review` → `/test-fix` |
| **Gate**    | Every PR — catch regressions before merge    | `/test-review` (branch diff) or `/test-review pr [number]` (PR comment)                      |

### Testing Commands

| Command          | Purpose                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/test-plan`     | Analyze code and produce a phased, prioritized test plan                                                                               |
| `/test-write`    | Execute a plan by spawning test-engineer subagents                                                                                     |
| `/test-review`   | Confidence-scored quality report (filter ≥80). Writes `.reviews/tests-{slug}.md`. `pr` mode posts a GitHub PR comment.                 |
| `/test-fix`      | Apply findings from a `.reviews/tests-{slug}.md` report (`--all` or `--findings=N,N,N`). Second mode: `from-rescan <file>` for ledger. |
| `/test-coverage` | Find coverage gaps and untested files                                                                                                  |
| `/test-triage`   | Grade test files (Clean/Minor/Bad/Rotten) for codebase remediation                                                                     |

### Common Flows

**PR gate** (most common — every branch before merge):

```
/test-review pr            → review + post PR comment (silent if no findings ≥80)
/test-fix --all            → applies every finding ≥80 from the latest report
# OR: /test-fix --findings=1,3,5   → pick specific findings
# OR: /test-review                 → local-only branch diff → .reviews/tests-branch-{name}.md
```

`/test-review` is diagnostic, not a gate — it produces a confidence-scored report; the human (or PR reviewer) judges what to action. `/test-fix` does not re-audit after applying.

**Ceiling pass** (one-shot on a critical module):

```
/test-coverage lib/auth        → finds coverage gaps
/test-plan coverage lib/auth   → produces phased plan
/test-write plan               → executes (spawns test-engineer agents)
/test-review lib/auth          → audits quality
/test-fix --all                → applies findings
```

**Add tests for branch changes** (no existing tests yet):

```
/test-plan           → produces phased plan from branch diff
/test-write plan     → executes Sprint 1
/test-review         → audits what was written (writes .reviews/tests-branch-{name}.md)
/test-fix --all      → fixes findings
```

The chain stops at `/test-fix`. Re-run `/test-review` only if the source changed after fixes, or on the next PR — do not loop reflexively.

**Codebase-wide test remediation (Floor)** — legacy green-bar cleanup:

```
/test-triage scan <folder>       → grade files, write to ledger
/test-triage worklist            → see prioritised queue (Rotten first)
/test-triage fix <file>          → print both fix paths (A: rescan-driven fast path · B: full review)
/test-fix from-rescan <file>     → path A: apply ledger NOTES directly (Minor/Bad with specific findings)
/test-review <file> → /test-fix  → path B: full audit then apply (Rotten, or vague findings)
/test-triage rescan <file>       → re-grade after fix, update ledger
```

Use `/test-triage` for quality remediation across 360+ files — it grades cheaply via regex + narrow Sonnet pass and tracks progress across sessions. Use `/test-review` for branch-scoped audit (1–20 file pairs).

**Quick test for 1-2 files** (skips planning):

```
/test-write lib/auth/guards.ts    → inline plan + execute
```

### How It Works

`/test-review` writes a **confidence-scored report** to `.reviews/tests-{slug}.md`: 5 parallel Sonnet agents (assertion quality, coverage, mock realism, brittleness, alignment) score findings 0–100, and the report shows findings ≥80. There is no auto-loop — the user (or PR reviewer) reads the report and picks what to action. `/test-fix` consumes a report by slug or by most-recent mtime.

`/test-coverage` and `/test-plan` chain via structured output: `/test-plan` consumes coverage findings to build sprint-based plans; `/test-write` executes plans by spawning **test-engineer** subagents (defined in `.claude/agents/test-engineer.md`).

All commands default to branch diff mode but accept file/folder paths. The test-engineer agent reads `.context/testing/` for patterns and validates tests pass lint and type-check before completing.

### Agent vs Skill vs Commands

| Use                     | When                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`/test-*` commands**  | Standard workflow — planning, writing, reviewing, coverage analysis |
| **test-engineer agent** | Spawned automatically by `/test-write` — don't invoke directly      |
| **`/testing` skill**    | Quick patterns reference, single test file guidance                 |

## Documentation

**Entry point:** `.context/substrate.md` — full navigation and AI usage patterns

> **Two namespace tiers are reserved for downstream forks — Sunrise core must
> never create files or tables under either.** `/app` is the **leaf-fork** tier
> (`.context/app/`, `lib/app/**` fork-owned scaffold, `components/app/**`, and
> `prisma/schema/app.prisma` — which ships empty; the platform's own app-domain
> models live in `prisma/schema/platform.prisma`). `/framework` is the
> **framework-layer** tier for forks that sit _between_ Sunrise and their own
> leaf forks (e.g. Daybreak): `lib/framework/`, `components/framework/`,
> `.context/framework/`, `prisma/schema/framework-*.prisma`, and the
> `framework_` table prefix. Keeping
> both empty upstream is what lets a fork's files there merge cleanly. Sunrise
> platform docs go under a named domain folder (below); the app boot seam is
> `lib/app/bootstrap.ts` (empty `initApp()`). See

## Troubleshooting

**Database connection fails:**

- Check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`
- In Docker: use `db` not `localhost`

**Build fails:**

- Run `npm run type-check` for errors
- Run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes

**Lint dies with ENOENT before reading any source file:**

- Stale paths in the ESLint cache (see the `coverage/**` note in `eslint.config.mjs`)
- Run `npm run clean:cache` — the toolchain caches are `.eslintcache` and
  `.prettiercache` at the repo root, so `rm -rf .next` no longer clears them (#677)

**Auth not working:**

- Verify `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is set
- Check `BETTER_AUTH_URL` matches app URL

**Peer dependency warnings (better-auth/Prisma):**

- Expected — `.npmrc` has `legacy-peer-deps=true`
- No action required
